 IF YOU USE A DIFFERENT UNITY VERSION, DO NOT COLLAB THE PROJECT VERSION FILE!
 
Changelog:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEBGL VERSION IS BACK BABY!
Fixed the issue where the tutorial text would appear if you select options when in the main menu
Added a pointer in the radar that activates when the boss spawns so the player knows which direction the boss is in
Changed volume slider to be logarithmic and not linear


 


To-do: 
--------------------------GAMEPLAY SHET------------------------------------
-Bullets need velocity data (forgot why)
-Change the tiled background to just an image since that would actually make sense


-----------------------------UI SHET--------------------------------------
-Change title screen a little to make it look cooler (yeah idk what to do here)
-Change the UI for inputting your name into the leaderboard (Slightly changed but not really)
-Add the ability to adjust resolution
-Create UI for it in the options menu
-Tutorial text detects if you start using controller


---------------------------AUDIO SHET-------------------------------------
-Pitch the sound of the engine based on speed.
-Give enemies movement sound effects
-Add sound effects for a level change
-Add sound effects for when the leaderboard comes up
-Add sound effects for an asteroid getting hit

--------------------------PARTICLE SHET------------------------------------
-Add a particle effect manager
-Add particle effect for asteroid
-Add particle effect for boss dying
-Particle effect for taking damage? (unsure if I should actually do that)

Issues:
-Occassionally when firing the bullets wont actually appear (They get warped to a random position??)
